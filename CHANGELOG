- 2019-03-14 1.9.0 beta: added deep features from VGG19 and a discriminator for GAN training.
Moved all non strictly architecture building operations outside of the model files.
The models are combined when needed in the Trainer class.
In order to allow for GAN training `fit_generator` function had to be replaced
with the more granular `train_on_batch`. Now the project relies on
custom data handlers and loggers instead of the custom Keras generator.
